thankyou-letters
================

Auto-generate thank you letters to send to your relatives after a Christmas gift.

This generates short but sweet thank you letters that can easily be sent to your relatives - if you set up the config file with the right grammar it'll be impossible to tell that it was auto-generated!

Replace Harry Potter with your name in the config file, and add entries for all of your presents!

Make sure to add 2 uses for each of your gifts (`'uses'` should be an array of length 2), and to add `'last_seen'` and `'did'` entries for the small talk at the end.
